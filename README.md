1. ### Bubble Sorting in JavaScript

    *JSX* is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for *JavaScript XML*). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

    In the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

    ```javascript
    const element = React.createElement(
      'div',
      {id: 'login-btn'},
      'Login'
    )
    ```
